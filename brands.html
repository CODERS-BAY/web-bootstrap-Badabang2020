                  The skateboard companies that are considered at the top
                  include Element Skateboards. Founded by professional
                  skateboarder Johnny Schillereff in 1992, the company’s goal
                  was to expand on Johnny’s “Elementality” vision to build a
                  company that helped to bring awareness to skateboarding. The
                  goal is to focus on its uses in nature and the environment and
                  the interconnecting of art and skateboarding. Developed from
                  an urban mentality that was rough around the edges, the brand
                  was transformed to embrace the “tree” logo with an emphasis on
                  the positive and making the world a better place. A customer
                  can purchase complete skateboards that include the decks,
                  wheels, trucks, and bearings or they can customize a deck to
                  suit their needs. Accessories and clothing are also offered.
                  There are 20 professional skateboarders on the Elements team
                  including such names as Brandon Westgate, Nyjah Houston, Mark
                  Appleyard and Nick Garcia.

                <p>
                  Launched in 1991 by professional skateboarder Mike Ternasky
                  who was killed in a car accident in 1994, Plan B Skateboards
                  was renewed in 2005 by professional skateboarders Danny Way
                  and Colin McKay. The top Skateboards brand, recognized by its
                  unique logo, offers customization, but it also produces
                  skateboards that come already assembled and ready for
                  immediate action with everything a skateboarder needs
                  including the deck, wheels, trucks, and bearings. The decks
                  are made with a durable and thick seven-ply maple. They are
                  also designed for you to make them uniquely yours with cool
                  graphics that reveal your personality. In addition to the
                  decks, Plan B also produces wheels, toolkits, and the kind of
                  hip clothing that every skateboarder wants to be seen wearing.
                  In addition to Way and McKay, the Plan B team consists of pro
                  skateboarders PJ Ladd, Chris Cole, Pat Duffy, Ryan Sheckler,
                  Torey Pudwill, Leticia Bufoni, Chris Joslin, Felipe Gustavo
                  and Sean Sheffey.

                  by professional skateboarders Mike Carroll and Rick Howard and

                <p>
                  Exploring ways of emulating snowboarding and surfing on land,
                  Loaded began as a passion (obsession?) in the mid 90s. We
                  scavenged Krypto Classics, Krypto 85s, Bones Hardcore wheels,
                  every new-fangled truck we could find, and retrofitted every
                  piece of wood or old snowboard we came across with trucks and
                  wheels. The decision to start a company occurred in September
                  of 2000 following a series of serendipitous events. After much
                  trial and error with all kinds of materials and production
                  methods, we launched our first board, The Vanguard, in June
                  2002.

                <p>
                  "Stereo was founded in 1992 when long term friends Jason Lee
                  and Chris Pastras decided the skateboarding world lacked what
                  creatively drove them. The brand turned the skate world on its
                  ears with timeless, classic, and totally original
                  inspirations." Together, Jason and Chris released two
                  skateboard films: A Visual Sound (’94) and Tincan Folklore
                  (’96). Going against the grain with the use of 8mm film, black
                  and white still photography and avant-garde music, the two
                  films are now revered as classics within the skateboard
                  community. Similarly, the "retro-modern" design aesthetic
                  Stereo brought to skate graphics in '92, was worlds away from
                  the cartoony, blood and guts filled design skateboarding was
                  accustomed too. Now with over 2 decades of heritage, Stereo
                  continues to be an influential skateboard brand. To this day,
                  each and every project and product produced by Stereo
                  remains... Timeless, Classic and Original.

                  decks and products designed for all types of skating. Our
                  boards are made in the U.S.A, and screenprinted by our own
                  hands. With our own in-house screen printing operation, MODE
                  keeps its graphics fresh, unique and always changing. We offer
                  unique base coatings, one-of-a-kind color combinations and
                  limited-edition print runs. That spontaneity keeps things
                  interesting, so check back often to see what we've come up
                  with.
